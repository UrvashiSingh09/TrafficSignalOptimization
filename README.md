 # AI-Based Traffic Signal Optimization ðŸš¦

An AI-powered smart traffic management system that dynamically controls signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions to reduce congestion and vehicle waiting time at intersections.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project aims to address urban traffic challenges by using real-time object detection and intelligent decision-making. It detects the number of vehicles using **YOLOv8** and applies **Fuzzy Logic** to optimize signal durations accordingly. The system features a full-stack architecture and a user-friendly interface for monitoring and visualization.
